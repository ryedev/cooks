        p Cooks sandals are made in America using salvaged materials and American made products. The process begins with salvaged polypropylene sacks, which are washed, cut, and sewn into strips. The polypropylene straps create a light and durable strap which does not retain moisture or stretch. These straps are plumbed into a foot bed made from live-harvested cork and recycled American tires.
